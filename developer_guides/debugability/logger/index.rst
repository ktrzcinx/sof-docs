Logger
######

Sof-logger is used to print logs delivered from FW dma_trace mechanism, by searching log
entries in *ldc* (*logs dictionary*) file generated by *SMEX* (*Sof Metadata Extractor*) tool.
Every entry declared in FW is placed in elf output file (e.g. sof-apl) in
.static_log_entries section in a form of struct defined in sof/src/include/sof/trace.h in sof fw repo.

*Ldc* file contains *snd_sof_logs_header* and *snd_sof_uids_header* (defined in smex/ldc.h).
*snd_sof_logs_header* is followed by .static_log_entries section incorporated from FW elf file (e.g. sof-apl).
snd_sof_logs_header contains basic information about .static_log_entries section
like base_address and data_length. Sof-logger works by reading entry parameters value and
entries addresses from FW dma_trace mechanism and searching suitable entry in *ldc* file
by its address.
*snd_sof_uids_header* struct is followed by .static_uuid_entries section content
from FW elf file. Single uuid entry is defined in sof/src/include/sof/lib/uuid.h in sof fw repo.

Logger usage
************

Usage sof-logger <option(s)> <file(s)>

-h 			help
-l ldc_file		Specify the ldc file
-i in_file		Get traces from in_file, instead of the default "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-o out_file 		Specify the output file, instead of default stdout
-t			Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace", instead of the default "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-p			Get traces from stdin, instead of the default "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-c clock		Set timestamp clock in MHz
-e			Enable checking firmware version with default verification file "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version"
-v ver_file 		Enable checking firmware version with ver_file file, instead of default: "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version"
-s			Take a snapshot of state
-r			Less formatted output for chained log processors
-d			Dump ldc information

Examples:

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file, verifies fw_version with
  "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version" and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -e

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file, verifies fw_version with
  ver_file file and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -v ver_file

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file and prints logs to
  out_file file

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -o out_file

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" file and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -t

- Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" file and prints logs to
  out_file file

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -t -o out_file

- Get traces from stdin and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -p

- Get traces from stdin and prints logs to out_file file

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -p -o out_file

- Get traces from trace_dump file and prints logs to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump

- Get traces from trace_dump file and prints logs to out_file file

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump -o out_file

- c flag is intended for defining clock value (in MHz) used to format log
  timestamps. By default clock value is set to 19.2 (MHz). Below example
  set clock value to 19.9 (MHz).

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump -o out_file -c 19.9

- Dump information from *ldc* (like ABI version and uuid dictionary) to stdout

.. code-block:: bash

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -d
